# Meal Tracking Data Deletion Summary

## Overview
Successfully deleted all meal tracking data from the database on $(date).

**UPDATE**: Data was initially not fully deleted. A second deletion was performed using direct SQL commands to ensure complete removal.

## Tables Affected
The following tables were targeted for data deletion:

1. **`meal_tracking`** - Main meal tracking records
2. **`meal_foods`** - Individual food items in meals  
3. **`food_database`** - Food items with nutrition data
4. **`meal_logging`** - Old meal logging table (not used)

## Deletion Results

### Before Deletion:
- `meal_tracking`: 14 records
- `meal_foods`: 0 records  
- `food_database`: 16 records
- `meal_logging`: Table doesn't exist (normal)

### After Deletion:
- `meal_tracking`: 0 records ✅
- `meal_foods`: 0 records ✅  
- `food_database`: 0 records ✅
- All meal tracking data has been successfully removed
- Table structures remain intact for future use
- Foreign key constraints were respected during deletion

## Scripts Created

### 1. JavaScript Script (`scripts/delete-meal-tracking-data.js`)
- Interactive script with safety warnings
- Shows data counts before and after deletion
- Handles errors gracefully
- 5-second delay to allow cancellation

### 2. SQL Script (`scripts/delete-meal-tracking-data.sql`)
- Direct SQL commands for manual execution
- Shows data counts before and after deletion
- Can be run directly in MySQL client

## Usage

### JavaScript Script:
```bash
node scripts/delete-meal-tracking-data.js
```

### SQL Script:
```bash
mysql -u root -ppr1k1t1w phc_dashboard < scripts/delete-meal-tracking-data.sql
```

## Notes
- ✅ All meal tracking data has been successfully deleted
- ✅ Table structures remain intact for future use
- ✅ Foreign key constraints were properly handled
- ✅ Scripts are reusable for future data cleanup needs

## Next Steps
If you need to restore meal tracking functionality:
1. The table structures are still intact
2. You can re-seed the `food_database` with food items
3. Users can start logging meals again through the mobile app
4. All API endpoints will continue to work normally
