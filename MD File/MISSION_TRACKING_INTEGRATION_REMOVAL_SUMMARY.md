## Files Modified

### Frontend Screens
The following screens have been updated to remove TrackingMissionService integration:

1. **WaterTrackingScreen.tsx**
   - Removed import of TrackingMissionService
   - Replaced `trackWaterAndUpdateMissions()` with direct `createWaterEntry()` API call
   - Removed mission completion notifications

2. **FitnessTrackingScreen.tsx**
   - Removed import of TrackingMissionService
   - Replaced `trackFitnessAndUpdateMissions()` with direct `createFitnessEntry()` API call
   - Removed mission completion notifications

3. **SleepTrackingScreen.tsx**
   - Removed import of TrackingMissionService
   - Replaced `trackSleepAndUpdateMissions()` with direct `createSleepEntry()` API call
   - Removed mission completion notifications

4. **MoodInputScreen.tsx**
   - Removed import of TrackingMissionService
   - Replaced `trackMoodAndUpdateMissions()` with direct `createMoodEntry()` API call
   - Removed mission completion notifications

5. **MealLoggingScreen.tsx**
   - Removed import of TrackingMissionService
   - Replaced `trackNutritionAndUpdateMissions()` with direct meal logging
   - Removed mission completion notifications

6. **ExerciseLogScreen.tsx**
   - Removed import of TrackingMissionService
   - Replaced `trackFitnessAndUpdateMissions()` with direct `createFitnessEntry()` API call
   - Removed mission completion notifications

7. **MissionDetailScreen.tsx**
   - Removed import of TrackingMissionService
   - Removed `autoUpdateMissionProgress()` calls
   - Simplified tracking data update logic

8. **MissionDetailScreenNew.tsx**
   - Removed import of TrackingMissionService
   - Removed `autoUpdateMissionProgress()` calls
   - Simplified tracking data update logic

### Backend API Endpoints
1. **Water Tracking API** (`dash-app/app/api/mobile/tracking/water/route.js`)
   - Removed auto-update mission calls
   - Simplified to only handle water tracking data

2. **Fitness Tracking API** (`dash-app/app/api/mobile/tracking/fitness/route.js`)
   - Removed auto-update mission calls for both exercise minutes and steps
   - Simplified to only handle fitness tracking data

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes
- All tracking screens now use direct API calls instead of the TrackingMissionService
- Removed mission completion notifications and success messages with mission info
- Simplified success messages to only show tracking data confirmation
- Removed mission progress auto-update functionality

### Backend Changes
- Removed the auto-update-missions API endpoint completely
- Removed mission auto-update calls from tracking endpoints
- Simplified tracking endpoints to only handle data storage

## Impact

### What's Removed
- Automatic mission progress updates when tracking activities
- Mission completion notifications during tracking
- Auto-assignment of missions when users start tracking
- Real-time mission progress synchronization
- Mission tracking integration database schema

### What Remains
- All tracking functionality (water, fitness, sleep, mood, nutrition)
- Mission system (viewing, joining, manual progress updates)
- User authentication and data storage
- Event emitter system for real-time updates
- All other app features

## Benefits of Removal
1. **Simplified Architecture** - Removed complex integration layer
2. **Reduced Complexity** - Fewer moving parts and dependencies
3. **Better Performance** - No additional API calls during tracking
4. **Easier Maintenance** - Less code to maintain and debug
5. **Cleaner User Experience** - Simpler, more focused tracking screens

## Migration Notes
- Users can still manually update mission progress through the mission detail screens
- All tracking data is still saved and accessible
- Mission system remains fully functional
- No data loss occurred during the removal process
