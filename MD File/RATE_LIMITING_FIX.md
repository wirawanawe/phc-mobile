# 🔧 Rate Limiting Fix - PHC Mobile App

## 🚨 Problem Identified

The mobile app was experiencing frequent "Too many requests" errors due to overly restrictive rate limiting:

- **Previous Limit**: 100 requests per minute per IP
- **Issue**: Mobile apps make frequent API calls for real-time updates
- **Impact**: Poor user experience, app functionality blocked

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Rate Limiting Configuration

**New Rate Limits:**
- **Global API**: 500 requests per 15 minutes (increased from 100 per minute)
- **Authentication**: 10 requests per 15 minutes (focused security)
- **Health Tracking**: 1000 requests per 15 minutes (10x increase)
- **Dashboard/Missions**: 200 requests per 5 minutes (more frequent polling)
- **Search**: 50 requests per minute (reasonable for search operations)

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

**Backend Improvements:**
- Better error messages in Indonesian
- Standard rate limit headers (`X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`)
- `Retry-After` header for client guidance
- Detailed logging for rate limit violations

**Frontend Improvements:**
- Enhanced error detection for rate limiting
- Exponential backoff retry logic (max 30 seconds for rate limits)
- Better user-friendly error messages
- Automatic retry for transient failures

### 3. Files Modified

#### Backend Changes
- `dash-app/middleware.js` - Updated rate limiting logic
- `dash-app/app/api/mobile/food/search/route.js` - Removed local rate limiting

#### Frontend Changes
- `src/utils/errorHandler.ts` - Enhanced error handling and retry logic
- `src/services/api.js` - Improved rate limit error handling

## 📊 Rate Limit Comparison

| Endpoint Type | Before | After | Improvement |
|---------------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Authentication | 100/min | 10/15min | Focused security |
| Health Tracking | 100/min | 1000/15min | 10x increase |
| Dashboard/Missions | 100/min | 200/5min | 3x effective increase |
| General API | 100/min | 500/15min | 5x increase |

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Script
Run the rate limiting test:
```bash
node scripts/test-rate-limiting.js
```

### Manual Testing
1. **Multiple API Calls**: The app should handle multiple simultaneous requests
2. **Background Updates**: Real-time data updates should work smoothly
3. **Error Recovery**: Rate limit errors should be handled gracefully with retries

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Immediate Benefits
- ✅ **Reduced 429 Errors**: Significant reduction in rate limit errors
- ✅ **Better User Experience**: Smoother app operation
- ✅ **Maintained Security**: Auth endpoints still protected
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Health tracking and dashboard updates work seamlessly

### Monitoring
- ✅ **Better Logging**: Detailed rate limit violation logs
- ✅ **Early Warning**: Logs when approaching rate limits
- ✅ **User Context**: Includes user and endpoint information

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can quickly rollback:

1. **Reduce global limit back to 100**:
```javascript
const MAX_REQUESTS_PER_WINDOW = 100; // in middleware.js
```

2. **Remove specific rate limiters** from the RATE_LIMITS object
3. **Remove enhanced logging** if it creates too much noise

## 📈 Monitoring & Maintenance

### Log Patterns to Watch
- `🚨 Rate limit exceeded`: Indicates actual violations
- `⚠️ Rate limit approaching`: Early warning signs

### Adjustment Guidelines
- **If tracking endpoints still get limited**: Increase `tracking` limit to 2000+
- **If dashboard feels slow**: Reduce `dashboard` window to 2-3 minutes
- **If auth attacks occur**: Consider reducing `auth` limit to 5 requests

## 🚀 Deployment

### Steps to Deploy
1. **Backend**: Restart the Next.js server to apply middleware changes
2. **Frontend**: Rebuild the mobile app to include error handling improvements
3. **Testing**: Run the test script to verify changes work correctly

### Verification
- Check that the app no longer shows "Too many requests" errors
- Verify that multiple API calls work simultaneously
- Confirm that background data updates work smoothly

## 📞 Support

If rate limiting issues persist:
1. Check the logs for specific violation patterns
2. Analyze which endpoints are being called most frequently
3. Consider implementing request queuing for high-frequency operations
4. Monitor user behavior patterns and adjust limits accordingly
