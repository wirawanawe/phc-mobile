# Wellness Access Control Fix

## 🔍 **Issue Description**

**Problem**: Users who haven't registered for the wellness program but have missions can still access the wellness dashboard.

**Expected Behavior**: Users should only be able to access the wellness dashboard if they have properly registered for the wellness program.

## ✅ **Root Cause**

The previous access logic was too permissive:

```javascript
// OLD LOGIC (Incorrect):
const hasWellnessAccess = hasWellnessProgram || hasMissions;
```

This allowed users to access the wellness dashboard if they either:
1. Had `wellness_program_joined = true` OR
2. Had active missions (count > 0)

## 🔧 **Solution Applied**

### **1. Frontend Fix (src/screens/WellnessApp.tsx)**

**Before**:
```javascript
// User can access wellness if they have joined the program OR have missions
hasWellnessAccess = hasWellnessProgram || hasMissions;
needsOnboarding = !hasWellnessAccess;
```

**After**:
```javascript
// User can access wellness ONLY if they have joined the program
// Missions alone are not sufficient - user must register for wellness program first
hasWellnessAccess = hasWellnessProgram;
needsOnboarding = !hasWellnessAccess;
```

### **2. Backend Fix (dash-app/app/api/mobile/wellness/status/route.js)**

**Before**:
```javascript
// Determine if user needs onboarding
const needsOnboarding = !user?.wellness_program_joined && missionCount === 0;
```

**After**:
```javascript
// Determine if user needs onboarding
// User needs onboarding if they haven't joined the wellness program
// Missions alone are not sufficient - user must register for wellness program first
const needsOnboarding = !user?.wellness_program_joined;
```

### **3. Debug Script Update (scripts/debug-wellness-access.js)**

**Before**:
```javascript
const shouldHaveAccess = hasWellnessProgram || hasMissions;
```

**After**:
```javascript
const shouldHaveAccess = hasWellnessProgram; // User must register for wellness program first
```

## 📋 **New Access Rules**

### **User CAN access wellness dashboard if:**
- ✅ `wellness_program_joined = true`

### **User CANNOT access wellness dashboard if:**
- ❌ `wellness_program_joined = false` (regardless of mission status)

## 🎯 **User Experience**

### **For Users Who Haven't Registered:**
1. ✅ Will see onboarding screen when accessing wellness
2. ✅ Must complete wellness program registration first
3. ✅ Cannot access dashboard until properly registered

### **For Users Who Have Registered:**
1. ✅ Can access wellness dashboard immediately
2. ✅ Can view missions, progress, and activities
3. ✅ Full access to all wellness features

## 🔄 **Migration Impact**

### **Existing Users with Missions but No Wellness Registration:**
- ❌ Will lose access to wellness dashboard
- ✅ Will be prompted to register for wellness program
- ✅ Can regain access after completing registration

### **Existing Users with Wellness Registration:**
- ✅ No impact - access remains unchanged

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **Test Cases:**

1. **New User (No Registration, No Missions)**
   - Expected: Shows onboarding screen
   - Status: ✅ Should work correctly

2. **User with Missions but No Registration**
   - Expected: Shows onboarding screen (not dashboard)
   - Status: ✅ Fixed with this update

3. **User with Registration but No Missions**
   - Expected: Shows wellness dashboard
   - Status: ✅ Should work correctly

4. **User with Registration and Missions**
   - Expected: Shows wellness dashboard
   - Status: ✅ Should work correctly

## 📝 **Files Modified**

1. `src/screens/WellnessApp.tsx` - Frontend access logic
2. `dash-app/app/api/mobile/wellness/status/route.js` - Backend access logic
3. `scripts/debug-wellness-access.js` - Debug script update

## 🎯 **Conclusion**

This fix ensures that users must properly register for the wellness program before accessing the wellness dashboard. The previous logic that allowed access based on missions alone has been removed, ensuring proper access control and user flow.
