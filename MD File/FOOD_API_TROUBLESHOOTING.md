# Food API Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue Fixed: Food API Endpoints Returning 404 Errors

### Problem Description
The food API endpoints were returning 404 errors with the message "Food not found" even when trying to access valid endpoints like `/food/categories`.

### Root Cause Analysis

#### 1. Route Ordering Issue
The main issue was in `backend/routes/food.js` where the generic `GET /:id` route was defined before specific routes like `/categories`, `/quick-foods`, etc.

**Problem:**
```javascript
// This was causing the issue
router.get("/:id", protect, async (req, res) => { ... });  // This route was first
router.get("/categories", protect, async (req, res) => { ... });  // This route never got reached
```

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Fixed by reordering routes
router.get("/categories", async (req, res) => { ... });  // Specific routes first
router.get("/quick-foods", protect, async (req, res) => { ... });
router.get("/:id", protect, async (req, res) => { ... });  // Generic route last
```

#### 2. Authentication Requirements
Some endpoints were requiring authentication when they should be publicly accessible:
- `/food/categories` - Should be public (no auth required)
- `/food/search` - Should be public (no auth required)
- `/food/:id` - Requires authentication (correct)

### Changes Made

#### Backend Changes (`backend/routes/food.js`)

1. **Reordered routes** to prevent path conflicts:
   - Moved `/categories` before `/:id`
   - Moved `/quick-foods` and related routes before `/:id`
   - Kept `/:id` route last to catch specific food ID requests

2. **Removed authentication requirement** from public endpoints:
   - `/food/categories` no longer requires `protect` middleware
   - `/food/search` already didn't require authentication (correct)

3. **Improved error handling**:
   - Added ID validation for the `/:id` route
   - Better error messages for invalid requests
   - Proper validation for required fields in POST requests

#### Frontend Changes (`src/services/api.js`)

1. **Added new API methods**:
   - `getFoodCategories()` - Get available food categories
   - `getFoodById(foodId)` - Get specific food by ID with better error handling
   - Improved `searchFood(query)` with better error handling

2. **Enhanced error handling**:
   - Better fallback behavior for API failures
   - More specific error messages
   - Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

### Testing Results

After implementing fixes, all endpoints work correctly:

```bash
# Categories endpoint - ✅ Working
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5432/api/food/categories"
# Returns: {"success":true,"data":["Rice Dishes","Chicken Dishes",...]}

# Search endpoint - ✅ Working  
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5432/api/food/search?query=nasi"
# Returns: {"success":true,"data":[{"id":1,"name":"Nasi Goreng",...}]}

# Get all foods - ✅ Working
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5432/api/food/search"
# Returns: {"success":true,"data":[...21 food items...]}

# Get food by ID - ✅ Working (requires auth)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5432/api/food/1" -H "Authorization: Bearer valid-token"
# Returns: {"success":true,"data":{"id":1,"name":"Nasi Goreng",...}}
```

### Prevention Tips

#### 1. Route Organization Best Practices
- Always define specific routes before parameterized routes
- Group related routes together (e.g., all `/quick-foods/*` routes together)
- Use clear route naming conventions

#### 2. Authentication Strategy
- Carefully consider which endpoints need authentication
- Use `protect` middleware only for routes that require user authentication
- Use `optionalAuth` for routes that can work both authenticated and unauthenticated

#### 3. Error Handling
- Provide specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- Include proper HTTP status codes
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging

#### 4. API Documentation
- Document which endpoints require authentication
- Provide example requests and responses
- Keep API documentation updated when routes change

### Food Database Status
- Database contains 21 food items (properly seeded)
- All food categories are available
- Search functionality works with Indonesian and English names

### Related Files Modified
- `backend/routes/food.js` - Main route fixes
- `src/services/api.js` - Enhanced frontend API handling
- Food database is properly seeded and functional

### Future Improvements
1. Add API endpoint documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
2. Implement proper API versioning
3. Add comprehensive logging for all food-related operations
4. Consider implementing food image upload functionality
5. Add nutrition calculation endpoints
