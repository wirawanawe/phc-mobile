# Database Connection Issue - Resolution Guide

## Problem Summary
Your React Native app was experiencing a "Server database is currently unavailable" error due to MySQL reaching its maximum connection limit (151 connections).

## Root Cause
- MySQL server was overwhelmed with too many concurrent connections
- The database connection pool was configured with high limits (20 connections, 50 queue limit)
- This caused the "Too many connections" error when the limit was reached

## Solution Applied

### 1. Immediate Fix
- Restarted MySQL service using `brew services restart mysql`
- This cleared all existing connections and restored normal operation

### 2. Database Configuration Improvements
Updated `dash-app/lib/db.js` with more conservative connection pool settings:

```javascript
const config = {
  // ... other settings
  connectionLimit: 10, // Reduced from 20 to 10
  queueLimit: 20, // Reduced from 50 to 20
  connectTimeout: 10000, // 10 seconds to connect
  acquireTimeout: 30000, // 30 seconds to acquire connection
  timeout: 30000, // 30 seconds query timeout
  idleTimeout: 60000, // Close idle connections after 60 seconds
  reconnect: true, // Enable automatic reconnection
};
```

### 3. Added Connection Monitoring
Created monitoring tools:
- `scripts/monitor-db-connections.js` - Monitor current connection usage
- `scripts/fix-db-connections.sh` - Quick fix script for future issues

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added pool event listeners for better monitoring
- Improved connection pool recreation logic
- Better timeout handling

## Current Status
âœ… **RESOLVED** - Database connection is working properly
- MySQL service: Running
- Connection usage: ~1.32% (2/151 connections)
- API endpoints: Responding correctly
- Mobile app should now work without database errors

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Monitor Connections Regularly
```bash
cd dash-app
node scripts/monitor-db-connections.js
```

### 2. Quick Fix Script (if issue reoccurs)
```bash
cd dash-app
./scripts/fix-db-connections.sh
```

### 3. Manual Fix Steps
If the quick fix script doesn't work:
1. Stop development server: `pkill -f "next dev"`
2. Restart MySQL: `brew services restart mysql`
3. Wait 5 seconds for MySQL to fully start
4. Restart development server: `npm run dev`

## Testing the Fix
The following endpoints are now working correctly:
- Health check: `http://localhost:3000/api/health`
- Mobile auth: `http://localhost:3000/api/mobile/auth/login`
- All other API endpoints should work normally

## Recommendations

### 1. For Development
- Use the monitoring script regularly during development
- Keep the fix script handy for quick resolution
- Consider reducing connection limits further if issues persist

### 2. For Production
- Monitor MySQL connection usage in production
- Set up alerts for high connection usage
- Consider using connection pooling at the application level
- Implement proper connection cleanup in your application code

### 3. Code Improvements
- Ensure all database connections are properly closed
- Implement connection timeouts in your application
- Add retry logic for database operations
- Consider implementing circuit breaker pattern for database calls

## Files Modified
- `dash-app/lib/db.js` - Updated connection pool configuration
- `scripts/monitor-db-connections.js` - New monitoring script
- `scripts/fix-db-connections.sh` - New fix script

## Next Steps
1. Test your React Native app to confirm the login works
2. Monitor connection usage during normal app usage
3. Consider implementing the prevention measures above
4. If issues persist, consider further reducing connection limits
