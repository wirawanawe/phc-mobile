# 🔧 Mood Tracker Rate Limiting Fix

## 🚨 Problem Identified

The mobile app was experiencing "Too many requests" errors specifically for mood tracking endpoints:

```
ERROR  Mood tracker API error: [Error: Too many requests. Please wait a moment and try again.]
```

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Mood tracking endpoints** (`/mobile/mood_tracking/`) were using the **default rate limit** (500 requests per 15 minutes)
- **Other tracking endpoints** were correctly using the **tracking rate limit** (1000 requests per 15 minutes)
- This inconsistency caused mood tracking to hit rate limits more frequently than other health tracking features

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Updated Middleware Configuration** (`dash-app/middleware.js`)

**Before:**
```javascript
function getEndpointType(pathname) {
  if (pathname.includes('/auth/')) return 'auth';
  if (pathname.includes('/tracking/') || pathname.includes('/mobile/tracking/')) return 'tracking';
  // ... other conditions
  return 'default';
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
function getEndpointType(pathname) {
  if (pathname.includes('/auth/')) return 'auth';
  if (pathname.includes('/tracking/') || pathname.includes('/mobile/tracking/') || 
      pathname.includes('/mood_tracking') || pathname.includes('/mobile/mood_tracking') ||
      pathname.includes('/wellness/') || pathname.includes('/mobile/wellness/')) return 'tracking';
  // ... other conditions
  return 'default';
}
```

### 2. **Key Changes Made**
- ✅ Added mood tracking endpoints to the `tracking` category
- ✅ Added wellness endpoints to the `tracking` category for consistency
- ✅ Removed trailing slashes from mood tracking path matching (fixed pathname format issue)

## 📊 Rate Limit Comparison

| Endpoint Type | Before | After | Improvement |
|---------------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Mood Tracking | 500/15min | 1000/15min | **2x increase** |
| Health Tracking | 1000/15min | 1000/15min | ✅ Unchanged |
| Wellness | 500/15min | 1000/15min | **2x increase** |
| General API | 500/15min | 500/15min | ✅ Unchanged |

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Before Fix:
```
📊 Rate Limit Info:
   - Limit: 500
   - Remaining: 492
❌ Mood tracking is still using DEFAULT rate limit (500 requests per 15 minutes)
```

### After Fix:
```
📊 Rate Limit Info:
   - Limit: 1000
   - Remaining: 996
✅ Mood tracking is now using TRACKING rate limit (1000 requests per 15 minutes)
```

## 🎯 Impact

### ✅ Benefits:
- **Reduced rate limiting errors** for mood tracking functionality
- **Consistent rate limits** across all health tracking features
- **Better user experience** with fewer interruptions
- **Improved app reliability** for mood tracking features

### 📱 User Experience:
- Users can now make more mood tracking entries without hitting rate limits
- Consistent behavior across all health tracking features
- Reduced frustration from "Too many requests" errors

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Files Modified:
- `dash-app/middleware.js` - Updated endpoint categorization logic

### Testing Scripts Created:
- `scripts/test-mood-rate-limit-fix.js` - Comprehensive rate limit testing
- `scripts/debug-middleware.js` - Debug script for middleware verification

### Rate Limit Categories:
- **Auth**: 20 requests per 15 minutes (focused security)
- **Tracking**: 1000 requests per 15 minutes (health data tracking)
- **Dashboard**: 200 requests per 5 minutes (dashboard/missions)
- **Search**: 50 requests per minute (search operations)
- **Default**: 500 requests per 15 minutes (general API)

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Monitor the fix** - Watch for any remaining rate limiting issues
2. **User feedback** - Check if mood tracking errors have decreased
3. **Performance monitoring** - Ensure the increased limits don't impact server performance

## 📝 Notes

- The fix was applied to both development and production environments
- All health tracking endpoints now use consistent rate limits
- The change is backward compatible and doesn't affect existing functionality
- Rate limiting headers are properly set for client-side error handling
